# Variable VVV - A VVV Site Wizard

This bash script makes it easy to spin up a new WordPress site using [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV).

Warning: This is currently in development and may not work correctly.

**Documentation is incoming when the tool gets a few more features and a bit more stable.**

## Installation

Put it somewhere in your $PATH.
You can also copy .vv-config-sample to ~/.vv-config and modify the value to stop ```vv``` from prompting you for your VVV path.

## Usage

For now, ```vv --help``` should show you everything you need to know.

## Questions?

Ping me on Twitter at [@bradparbs](http://twitter.com/bradparbs).

## Thanks

Forked and based off of [vvv-site-wizard from Alison Barrett](https://github.com/aliso/vvv-site-wizard).
